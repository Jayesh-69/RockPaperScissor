## Pseudo code
- Will take input number of objects, speed.
- Will randomly place all the objects in the canvas.
- Now all will move in all the 8 directions by the speed we provide. Here we can also move an object in such a manner that it try to win like paper should move to the nearest rock rock to nearest scissor and scissor to nearest paper.
- As per the rule of RPS(Rock, Paper and Scissor) we will convert the objects when they collide.
- When all the object becomes one we end the game loop and declare the winner.
